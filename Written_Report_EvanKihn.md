# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
* Using the data we have worked with the first two weeks of class, the Kickstarter assignment empahsizes the skills and analysis we have examined so far in Module 1. These include the use of functions involving COUNTIFS, SUMS, VLOOKUPS, etc.; additionally, creating useful line and bar charts will cover the visualization of the data set we are instructed to work with. 

### Purpose
* The purpose of this project was to help Lousie, creator of the play Fever, get a clearer picture of different campaign's fundraising goals in relation to their launch date. This relationship will be analyzed using excel functions as well as the charts and graphs that paint the bigger picture. 

## Analysis and Challenges
* The analysis of each seperate deliverable asked us to use our newly polished excel skills to get two seperate representations of the data set when it came to different campaign's success rates as well as their fundraising goals. We dive deeper into each analysis below. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
* Using the kickstarter data, our analysis in deliverable 1 began with creating a new column in the spreadsheet labeled "Years" that would be extracted by the "Date Created Conversion Column". The following link shows the use of the formula in my kickstarter sheet.

* From there, the analysis leads to developing a table and graph that focuses on the relationship of theatre outcomes (successful, failed, and cancelled) and the time of the year they occur during all years included as a launch date. The picture of this graph is below.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
* Next, our deliverable involved using the kickstarter data to filter out all of the fundraising goals from smallest to largest. Our subcategory was specific to plays, and we would be using formulas to get a count of the outcomes (successful, failed, and cancelled) of each campaign when it came to the level of goal they reached.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
* I think the only real challenge I encountered came when compiling and making sure my COUNTIF statements were correct in the analysis of outcomes based on goals. I found myself going back to the kickstarter sheet mulitple times to make sure that the numbers I was generating were correct.

## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    * The first outcome we can conclude is that for the parent category "Theater", successful outcomes led the way with 839 campaigns, followed by 493 failed, and 37 cancelled. In May and June, these "Theater" campaigns peaked with back to back months of over 100 labeled as successful. December provided the only example of a month where the amount of canclled and failed campaigns together had more volume than ones that were considered successful.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    * The conclusions that can be drawn about the outcomes based on goals, subcategorized by plays, is that around 80% of the total projects targeted their goal from three ranges: "Less than 1000", "1000 to 4999", and "5000 to 9999". This perhaps means that these founders estimated that donors would not be attracted to projects that eclipsed the $10,000 level. Our graph shows some volatility in the percentages of failed-successful-cancelled, however, the number of successful camapigns well outwieghs the failed endevours. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    * I really don't see many limitations of the dataset. One thing that stands out to me is how we really define what successful or failed campaigns really are. Is it based on whether or not campaign gets fully funded, or are there other ways to add more objectivity? 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    * I think a group of interesting tables could be a brekadown of each countries outcomes for each camapaign. This what give us indiciation of the strengths and or weaknesses of each countries economy, and perhaps what one country specializes in versus what another may not priotize as much.
